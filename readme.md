# Syntax higlighting in Rust

This repo contains my experiments with [syntect](https://github.com/trishume/syntect) +
custom syntaxes and themes. Initially, I faced some problems in converting from `.tmLanguage`
to `.sublime-syntax` due to a bug in Sublime Text. Luckily, there was a workaround which is
mentioned [here](https://forum.sublimetext.com/t/trying-to-convert-tmlanguage-syntax-to-sublime-syntax/53427).
